    Hey guys,

 <p>I am Ansh Mehrotra and this is my first blog. This blog is about when I faced something which not only me but lot of people start getting goosebumps at the name of it.

I admit that I am a big wimp when it comes to things like- vaccinations, operations, extractions, root canals and basically all such things (you get the idea I suppose.) The fear I faced was tooth extraction😓😓😓.

Before any misunderstandings come across you dear reader, I just want to make it clear that my teeth are perfectly fine and there are no frequent problems. My sister though, has a lot of problems with her teeth. She has become a regular visitor to the dentist.
She has faced problems like tooth decay like a hundred times (ok, maybe hundred and ten hahaha), root canals and also tooth extraction. She was basically used to all this. When she went to the dentist I sat outside enjoying the comfort, playing with the toys and wondering how really good my teeth are😁. I never thought this day would come across.

Then in November, 2018 I had this white bulge coming above both my canines in the upper jaw. When consulted the doctor he said that it is an extra tooth 😠(come on, man) and I had two choices-
1. Either eat hard stuff like carrots (yuck) or almonds and break the permanent tooth

OR
2. You guessed it- Tooth Extraction

My expressions when I heard option 2-.😓😢😟😟

Even with all those A+ teeth I have to do this. The doctor had given me a deadline of the second week of December and you wouldn't believe how much I delayed it. Try guessing. 



Congratulations to the people who guessed APRIL!!! I know right, I postponed it by 5 months because I was so scared, half the time I didn't let my parents come to that topic and in March I told them that exams were nearing and I can't afford to be distracted(I am smart that way).

But to my surprise my dad took an appointment of April 14, exactly 2 days after my exams were supposed to get over and they didn't tell me this until my exams ended so that I don’t get distracted(that backfired on me😟).





 

April 14, 2019


I know guys, the big day. The day where someone plucks my tooth out (did I tell you that I couldn't break my teeth with almonds and carrots, oh the unfairness).
The night before the extraction I couldn't sleep till 1a.m in the night.

The next day during the whole way in the car I was freaked out. My body was full of nervous energy. It was like a helium
balloon was being inflated inside me waiting to be popped😟😟😟. When we reached the dentist's place I was too reluctant to go up. It was as if I was going to jump in a well. At this moment thinking of it strongly reminds me of the day in which my mom surprised me by taking me to the doctor to get vaccinated, but that, my friends is another story which I will share soon with you. Anyway, where was I, oh! right, my doomsday.

The dentist's clinic was on the 2nd floor. The whole building was basically a complex and the dentist's office was a small part of it. When we reached up there I was sweating, but not from exertion of climbing the stairs (2 floors are not tiring), but from fear. Inside the office we were to wait for our appointment. For the waiting of the patients there were a number of toys in the waiting room. Normally during my sister's appointments I used to sit outside enjoying with the toys (as I mentioned above), but that day I was too nervous to even move from my place.
It was very tedious waiting there my heart beating as fast as a cheetah. I guess it almost skipped a beat when I heard the words-"Ansh Mehrotra, the doctor will see you now"😓😓.

My feet were literally shivering as I made my way inside the dentist's room.
He smiled at me and told me to sit on the chair. I saw all those pointy tools that you see at a dentist's clinic, if you have ever been to one. The doctor saw where I was staring and laughed. He told me those tools were not for me, which still didn't exactly reassure me. I didn't know how trustworthy a dentist was.

 

Out of his drawer he took out a cream which he said was a kind of anesthesia. He said it didn't make my nerves dormant completely but it will reduce the pain (ugh...enough biology). He then took out a pair of small pliers which I immediately knew would be used to pluck out my tooth.

He put the cream which gave me a tingling sensation in my gums. He said he would also give me an injection to give the complete effect of the anesthesia, but I wasn't going to put an injection on my gums. I told him that I'd rather bear the pain than put an injection, and he agreed.

He then put the pliers to my teeth. I waited for the immense fountain of pain to come over me. A wave of adrenaline washed through me. He held it and- PLUCK! Then another PLUCK! At first I was surprised because it felt like nothing. It was hardly any pain, and that, coming from me really means there was no pain. The doctor put cotton between the teeth which were extracted.
The extraction was complete😌😌😌.

But after that it did hurt a lot. My gums felt like there were thorns in it. The whole way back it hurt a lot.

I think I wasted a lot of time being scared even though facing it was so easy (of course I didn't know that back then). Also as I said it was hurting a little on the way back, but I got to face my fear (oh and I also got some ice cream🍨🍨🍨🍨😀😀😀).

Anyway guys that was it for today. I will surely write back about more incidents. If you liked this blog of mine then please subscribe and comment your views about the blog, until we meet again, bye guys😉😉.

<h1 class="blogs"> Blog #2</h1>


Hey guys, 

I am back. I hope you remember me (Ansh Mehrotra☺). Anyways, in this blog I am going to teach a chapter of physics called The Laws of Motion and........NO, NO, NO, NO WAIT. I am just kidding guys don't leave, (I would be insane to do that in a blog.😁), So the story of this blog is quite recent and so it is fresh in my exceptionally awesome mind. Now, for those of you who reading my blog in 2020, will understand the situation, (hopefully you don't read this 30 years after I write it.) The story of this blog traces back to..... 

2020 (uh..yeah, this year) 

 Yes friends, 2020. The year of complete boredom and lockdown and screen time and online school and...yeah you get the idea. If you don't understand then read my book: The disasters of 2020, (no I am just kidding, that book exists only in my mind till now, may be I will write it one day..in a few years). This was probably the first time in my life, (and for probably quite a lot people as well), I had experienced a complete lockdown, (I am telling you friends it is not fun at all.) I hadn't gone to play in 5 months, (quite an achievement). When this whole lockdown thing started it was actually a little fun for some days, (mind you only for some days), as we got something new to experience which I hadn't come across in my whole 12 years of life. 

It was a new experience for all, (except maybe those who witnessed world war II). My exams were going on in March. I had just given 3 exams- Math, Language and Hindi. I positively remember that after giving my Hindi exam I was studying Biology as the next exam was Science. I felt a little fatigue at that time so I decided to take short nap. When I woke up I got a big surprise. My mom told me not to study. When I asked the reason, I was shown a notice issued by my school. It said that my school was shunned down till 31 March and the exams were postponed. Further updates will be given later. 

Quite a lot of emotions washed over me at that moment- surprised, happy, sad. You must be wondering why I was sad. It was because the exams would be a burden on my shoulders till that time. But my mom reassured me by saying the situation might not improve till then, (thanks mom). So basically I was free to play as much as I want, (the most awesome thing.) But after 5 or 6 six days of joyful freedom my mom and dad banned my playing out of the house for health safety reasons, (RUBBISH.). So...all I could do was watch TV and watch TV and watch TV and...yeah that's pretty much all I did (I know right? busy schedule I had😂). Then my mom started teaching me a little 8 grade math with one of my best friend- LUCKY. The math classes my mom gave were really........boring (I really hope my mom doesn't read this blog.) 

 By the end of March I was getting a little annoyed by this whole lockdown situation and by April mid I was getting tortured by boredom. But I can admit anytime that I would prefer that complete boredom and isolation over what happened after some days. 23 April, 2020, (I think that was the date), I was watching a movie with my sister when my mom came in and gave me some horrible news. She showed me a notice which gave a whole timetable of........you guessed it SCHOOL and it was to start the next day itself, (unfair. By the way did I tell you that the exams were permanently cancelled and I was promoted to grade 8. Awesome!!!) 

I had to close down the movie and sleep immediately so I get up the next day to have a horrible day. When school first started it wasn't that bad. It was 3 hours only and we hardly got any homework. This continued for about a week or two. Then we got a 4 day break from school, (oh yeah.) They were finding a new online platform for school. After 4 days, they decided to work on Microsoft Teams, ( I had to admit, the app is real good). After the platform got decided, school got worse, (lot more worse than it was). We started getting loads of homework. Now that my school has started in full swing, my life had become.....horrible, (there are other adjectives which I can't write). I wanted a break from school. My school granted my wish-

 On the 8th of May, in the last period, my teacher said that we will get summer holidays till 31st May, (awesome.) Those 23 days were the best days of those 2 months. To add to the fun, my dad took amazon prime video (yeah.) After that I watched a movie everyday. But as they say, time flies. I hardly even knew how fast the day of 31st May arrived, (noooooo😢😢.) I was too reluctant to go to school the next day (or let's say- let the school come to my home). But I had no choice. 

I was really sleepy the next day. Since then I have got no such break from school. Till today my school has tortured me. At first they had kept classes on Saturday also, (the most rubbish thing ever), But after a few weeks they stopped that, because my mom, and a lot of other moms, taking my moms suggestion, had written about 4 complaints to ban Saturday school , after which, my school finally listened to it, (I owe you big time, mom). For the past 3 months, our school runs for 5 hours a day, for 5 days a week. My sister's grade though, (she is in the same school, just 3 years younger), is going quite slow. They started school 2 months after mine started. Also they didn't have Saturdays school from the beginning and had only 3 hours a day (totally unfair.) 

30 August, 2020 

 Only two weeks ago my tests got over. It went for 16 days. After my tests, my family went for a drive to a resort, (we just went to see it not to live in it, of course). But that, my friends, I will cover in my next blog. After my tests finished, I was looking forward for a long week of pure relaxation😆. But alas! my school wasn't going to let me relax. My teachers soon told me that the term end examinations will be taking place from the 14th of September. Yes friends, only 15 days left. 

 Looks like I gotta spend the whole of next month in studies, (basically all I have been doing for the past 5 months). So...I've gotta go and study now and have to bid you guys goodbye.

So friends, that was it for today. Yes, I know I should have kept some happy ending but this lockdown is still going on. I am still waiting for that golden day when this all will be over and I will get to live that normal life again, (which I miss badly. Sorry for this guys.) Till then, the waiting will continue for me and you. But as soon as this ends I will surely write a blog about the end of lockdown too.

 Also, my exams are starting from the 14th of September, (which you all must have read above), and its not far. So I must start studying and hence I can't write blogs till 30th September But after that I promise to write another thrilling blog and this is a promise I will surely keep. So buckle up and fasten your seatbelts because the next blog will be great, (it will be about when i got out of the house last week by breaking lockdown. Just wait till 30 September.)
